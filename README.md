# Advanced XRD Analysis

## Description

This page offers DL-driven tools for analyzing powder XRD. With this tool, users can accurately predict X-ray diffraction (XRD) results for 7 crystal systems, 101 extinction groups, and 230 space groups. In addition, a GAN(pix2pix) is used to process single-phase powder XRD and produce high-quality results. This package simplifies crystallographic analysis for materials scientists.

Users can download 197,131 standard XRD Patterns, perturbed XRD patterns, and texture-perturbed XRD patterns from the ./XRD_analysis.ipynb notebook file.
